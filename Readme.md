## Yet Another Simple Network Library

It's not a special library for this time, my goal is to develop a simple network library for practicing various coding skills, and I hope this gets to the road that I have a multi-platform library at last.

It supports blocking TCP sockets for now, but I will add some more features to it.

BTW, It has some descriptions in a blog post that will become available as soon as possible.
